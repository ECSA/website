    <p>
        There are various services that ECSA provides to ECV residents, other than hosting
        <a ui-sref="main.events">events</a>. All our services are provided in
        <a ui-sref="main.house">ECSA House</a>, and some services are only available
        during <a ui-sref="main.volunteer_calendar">volunteer hours</a>.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
        One service that is offered during volunteer hours is printing and scanning for only 5 cents per page. This
        is a much cheaper price than other places on campus!
